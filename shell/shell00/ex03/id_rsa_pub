This exercise is to learn how to generate your ssh-key to use in intranet. 
You just need to use following command in terminal: (without quotes) "ssh-keygen".

I recommend that you use this command in following path: "~/.ssh"
"~" is your home folder.
"." files or folders with dot at beggining are hidden files/folder.

If you are not in this folder you can use de following command to go for this folder in any place that you are in your terminal -> "cd ~/.ssh"

One time here, just use the command and then destroy your SSH-key in intranet and replace with public ssh-key (content inside of id_rsa.pub file) and then copy the same key that you used in intranet in a file called "id_rsa_pub" in your exercice folder.
